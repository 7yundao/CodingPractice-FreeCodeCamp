        <ul class="biography">
          <li><span class="year">1955</span> - Born on 8 June in London, England. His parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1976</span> - Graduated from The Queen's College, Oxford with first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1978</span> - Helped creating type-setting software for printers at D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1980</span> - Proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE at CERN.</li>
          <li><span class="year">1989</span> - CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet. "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web."</li>
          <li><span class="year">1990</span> - Published the world's first-ever website and web server info.cern.ch and the first webpage address http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html </li>
          <li><span class="year">1994</span> - Founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.</li>
          <li><span class="year">2004</span> - Accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.</li>
          <li><span class="year">2004</span> - Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the New Year Honours "for services to the global development of the internet".</li>
          <li><span class="year">2009</span> - Then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force. Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free re-use.</li>
          <li><span class="year">2013</span> - Lead the lauch of the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) which is the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft. The A4AI seeks to make internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online.</li>
          <li><span class="year">2016</span> - Received the ACM Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale."</li>
          <li><span class="year">2017</span> - Urged the FCC to cancel a vote to uphold net neutrality. The letter was addressed to Senator Roger Wicker, Senator Brian Schatz, Representative Marsha Blackburn and Representative Michael F. Doyle.</li>
          <li><span class="year">2018</span> - Announced his new open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project, which aims to give users more control over their personal data and lets users choose where the data goes, who's allowed to see certain elements and which apps are allowed to see that data.</li>

      <p id="quote"><br><br>"He wove the World Wide Web and created a mass medium for the 21st century. The World Wide Web is Berners-Lee's alone. He designed it. He loosed it on the world. And he more than anyone else has fought to keep it open, nonproprietary and free."
